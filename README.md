# Machine Learning (Coursera)
This is my solution to all the programming assignments and quizzes of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
